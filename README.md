## letscode - interactive coding platform

<img src="./letscode-logo.png" alt="LetsCode Logo" style="width: 200px; display: inline;"/>
**letscode** is an open source web-based, interactive coding platform for university students.
We believe, daily training and improving of coding skills is necessary for a better understanding of theoretical concepts.

Students may use the **letscode** platform by enrolling into courses and solving tasks.

Moderators and Administrators have additional features, including Course Management or User Management.

**Please note:** This project is work in progress and absolutely far away from beeing ready for production use!

### Constributions

The **letscode** platform is actively maintained and developed by OpenDevSpace,
a student group creating open source applications at Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences.
We are always looking for people and groups, who want to join us or support our development.
